# EPScheduleApp


The goal of the EPHS Schedule App is to coordinate all Eden Prairie schedule information into one platform. The app features three main views: a home page displaying the main schedule, a second page featuring EP's FLEX schedule, and a third page that includes helpful links. The home page allows the user to input information on each of their class periods, like class name, teacher name, location, and additional notes. The second/FLEX page has this same functionality, but adapts the schedule to fit the FLEX times and schedule changes. The final page features schedule-related links for students, like the lunch schedule, calendar updates, and access to EP's counselors/career services.
